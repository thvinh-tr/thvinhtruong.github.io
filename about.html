About me:
- Hello, there, I am a computer science student with curiosity about how computer can conquer human :)
- I am currently studying in Vietnamese German University and will begin a new semester in Frankfurt University of Applied Science.
- I am working on some stuffs about AI, math,... (I am still lucky that my mom and dad can earn enough money to feed me :D)

- In fact, i am not truly an intelligent or hard working person. However, i always pass the exam with fine grades, which is always enough for something.
- With this blog, I hope to get a lot of attention and become a Hollywood star or something.
- However, you guys can check my CV or Resume here:...
